<title>In the air tonight</title>
<text>
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment, all my life, Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, Oh Lord, Oh Lordiuouio
</text><text>
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand

It's all been a pack of lies
</text><text>
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Oh Lord, Oh Lord
</text><text>
And I'm the Human, I'm strong and furious, and when you know my name then will be too late. For Everything!
</text><text>
Well I remember, I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget,
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, no you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show; but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you or me
</text><text>
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, Oh Lord, Oh Lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, Oh Lord, Oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord, Oh Lord
