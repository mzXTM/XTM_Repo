<resource>King of the HillIt seems to have been a while since we last talked, pilot. I wondered if you were ignoring me and had made some new friends? Still, not to worry, you’re here now and we can work together and help challenge the alien threat. So while you blow them away for rewards I send some of my remotes to scan the area for changes in the tech! Deal?Tech GrabI’m worried about the number of other people you’ve been working for lately. You could pick up all sorts of bad manners working with them, far better you keep working for your more compatible friends like Nyx and, of course, me. Keep the spread of the others influence contained. We’ve got your back, remember that!Spread of InfluenceWe’re playing a dangerous game now, like running with knives in the dark. We’re pushing the aliens back but more and more keep flooding into our area. I’m concerned that something is wrong on their home worlds, as they seem to prefer to battle in a war zone against humanity and each other. Something’s changing and it isn’t good!Running with KnivesYou’ve done a great job, pilot. You’ve challenged the aliens and made sure they got the message. However, I know some of you want to show you’re at the top of your game. So please take the opportunity to help secure our regions of space. Making it easier for traders and other civilian ships to have safe passage.King of the Hill  </resource>
